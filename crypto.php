          ROI means return of investment

  Return on investment is a ratio between net profit and cost of investment. A high ROI means the investment's gains compare favourably to its cost. As a performance measure, ROI is used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or to compare the efficiencies of several different investments.<br><br>

  Now imagine you had just invested $100 back in 2009, crazy Profits right? Now imagine you had just invested $100 back in 2009, that’ll earn you about 145BTC, Which at the time of typing this is worth over $1,509,160 now tell me that isn’t amazing.<br><br>

  Now don’t feel too hard on yourself mate, it’s not too late. I myself got into crypto as at early 2013. Been in no less than $2.7M in Profits since then.<br><br>
